# AGTX - Terminal Kanban for Coding Agents

A terminal-native kanban board for managing multiple coding agent sessions (Claude Code, Codex, Gemini, Copilot, OpenCode, Cursor, Grok, Antigravity) with isolated git worktrees.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Build
cargo build --release

# Run in a git project directory
./target/release/agtx

# Or run in dashboard mode (no git project required)
./target/release/agtx -g

# Enable experimental features (orchestrator agent)
./target/release/agtx --experimental

# Never run init_script / cleanup_script from project or plugin config
./target/release/agtx --no-init-scripts

# Trust the current project's config (enables its scripts and copy_files)
./target/release/agtx trust

# Run the MCP server (global mode, or project-scoped with a path)
./target/release/agtx mcp-serve [path]

# Serve the board to a phone (feature = "serve"; loopback needs no pairing)
./target/release/agtx serve [path] [--host 0.0.0.0] [--port 8787] [--tunnel private|public]
./target/release/agtx serve --devices          # paired devices
./target/release/agtx serve --revoke <id>      # or --revoke-all

# Record an agent lifecycle event (invoked by agent hooks, not by hand)
./target/release/agtx hook --env <agent> [--event <Name>] < payload.json

# Version, and self-update to the latest GitHub release
./target/release/agtx --version
./target/release/agtx update [--check]
```

Logs are JSON at `~/.config/agtx/logs/agtx.log` (daily rotation, `RUST_LOG` respected).

## Key Concepts

### Task Workflow
```
Backlog → Planning → Running → Review → Done
```

- **Backlog**: Task ideas. Also hosts the optional **Research** phase (`R`), which runs in place. No separate `Research` status — `TaskStatus` is `Backlog | Planning | Running | Review | Done`; Backlog's display name is `backlog/research`.
- **Planning**: Creates git worktree at `{worktree_dir}/{slug}` (default `.agtx/worktrees/{slug}`), copies files, runs init script, deploys skills, starts agent.
- **Running**: Agent implementing. **Review**: optionally create PR; tmux window stays open; can resume. **Done**: cleanup worktree + tmux window (branch kept locally), runs `cleanup_script` first.
- Backlog can skip to Running (`M`); Running can go back to Planning (`r`).

**Removing a worktree** — `RealGitOps::remove_worktree` (`git/operations.rs`); all cleanup paths (Review→Done, force-move, delete `x`) go through it on a background thread. Refuses a main working tree (no-op `Ok`); `is_main_working_tree` checks the toplevel (`--show-toplevel`), not just the git dir. A failed removal prunes (`git worktree prune`) and returns `Err`. `delete_task_resources` removes the worktree independently of a branch; `delete_branch` (`git branch -D`) stays paired with having had a worktree.

**Reaping spawned processes** — `kill-window` misses processes backgrounded into their own group. `reap_task_processes` finds them by environment (`AGTX_TASK_ID` set on the window by `create_window`, inherited by children — catches daemons) and by descent from the pane (backstop, runs before `kill_window`). `processes_for_task` reads `/proc/<pid>/environ` else `ps`. A root pid (0/1) or agtx's own pid is refused. Children signalled before parents (TERM then KILL) via the `kill` command.

**agtx's own files excluded from git** — `exclude_agtx_files_from_git` writes `AGTX_WRITTEN_PATHS` into `$GIT_COMMON_DIR/info/exclude` at worktree setup (per-worktree `info/exclude` is ignored by git). Exclude patterns affect untracked files only. Makes `git add -A` safe in the phase skills.

**The phase skills commit** — `execute.md` and `review.md` end by committing (Done requires a clean tree; merging requires commits).

**A repository with no commits** — `has_no_commits` → `create_initial_commit` (`git commit --allow-empty -m init`), since a worktree must be cut from a commit. `detect_main_branch` checks the exit status of its `git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD` fallback.

### Workflow Plugins
Plugins customize the lifecycle per phase. A plugin is `plugin.toml` defining: **commands** (slash commands sent per phase, auto-translated; supports `preresearch` + `research`), **prompts** (`{task}`/`{task_id}`/`{phase}` templates), **artifacts** (completion paths, `*` wildcards), **prompt_triggers** (text to wait for), **init_script** (`{agent}` placeholder), **copy_dirs**/**copy_files**/**copy_back**, **cyclic** (Review→Planning with incrementing phase, `p`), **clear_context_on_advance** (send a clear-context command before the phase skill; Claude `/clear`, pi `/new`, no-op for the rest), **supported_agents** (whitelist, empty = all), **auto_dismiss**.

Phase gating is derived from config: a phase whose command/prompt contains `{task}` can be entered directly from Backlog; otherwise it needs a prior phase artifact. A phase with no command AND no prompt (void) is ungated. No `research_required` flag.

Resolution: project-local `.agtx/plugins/{name}/` → global `~/.config/agtx/plugins/{name}/` → bundled (`load_task_plugin` falls back to bundled). `discover_custom_plugins` (`src/skills.rs`) surfaces on-disk plugins alongside `BUNDLED_PLUGINS` in the board selector (`P`) and wizard (project-local shadows global; bundled-name collisions skipped; filtered by `supported_agents`). Each task stores its plugin name explicitly; switching the project plugin only affects new tasks.

### Skill System
Skills are markdown with YAML frontmatter deployed to agent-native paths in worktrees. Canonical copy always at `.agtx/skills/agtx-plan/SKILL.md`.

| Agent | Skill path |
|-------|-----------|
| claude | `.claude/commands/agtx/plan.md` |
| gemini | `.gemini/commands/agtx/plan.toml` (TOML) |
| codex | `.codex/skills/agtx-plan/SKILL.md` |
| cursor | `.cursor/skills/agtx-plan/SKILL.md` |
| grok | `.grok/skills/agtx-plan/SKILL.md` |
| antigravity | `.agents/skills/agtx-plan/SKILL.md` (vendor-neutral) |
| opencode | `.opencode/command/agtx-plan.md` (frontmatter stripped) |
| copilot | `.github/agents/agtx/plan.md` |

`write_skills_to_worktree()` also drops a **per-agent MCP config** pointing at `agtx mcp-serve <project>`:

| Agent | File | Format |
|-------|------|--------|
| claude | `.mcp.json` | JSON, `mcpServers` |
| codex | `.codex/config.toml` | TOML, `[mcp_servers.agtx]` |
| gemini | `.gemini/settings.json` | JSON, `mcpServers` + `trust: true` |
| cursor | `.cursor/mcp.json` | JSON, `mcpServers` |
| grok | `.grok/config.toml` | TOML, `[mcp_servers.agtx]` |
| antigravity | `.agents/mcp_config.json` | JSON, `mcpServers` |
| opencode | opencode config | JSON, `mcp` |
| pi | `.pi/mcp.json` | JSON, `mcpServers` |

Four writers (grok, antigravity, gemini, pi) **merge** instead of overwriting (their file may already exist — tracked, or copied from the project root by `AGENT_CONFIG_DIRS`). Claude's `settings.local.json` side-effect merges too and gets `enableAllProjectMcpServers: true` + `skipDangerousModePermissionPrompt: true` (avoids a first-open dialog). `write_skills_to_worktree` also seeds antigravity's `trustedWorkspaces` when the project root is trusted (`agent::trust`; home lookups via `agent_trust_home()` honouring `AGTX_AGENT_HOME`).

Commands are written once canonical (`/ns:command`) and auto-translated: Claude/Gemini `/ns:command`; OpenCode/Cursor/Grok/Antigravity `/ns-command`; Codex `$ns-command`; Copilot prompt-only.

**MCP pre-handshake filter** — Antigravity probes stdio servers with `server/discover` before `initialize`, which rmcp treats as fatal. `src/mcp/prehandshake.rs` answers pre-handshake requests with JSON-RPC `-32601` and keeps the connection open; once `initialize` is forwarded it is a pass-through (`filtered_stdio()` in `src/mcp/server.rs`).

### Sending Skills & Prompts to Agents
Two lanes.

**Launch lane** (first message of a task's life, and the first visit to a switched agent instance): skill + prompt composed by `compose_launch_text()` and handed to the process in **argv**. Returning to an instance recorded in `Task::session_agents` resumes it instead. Gated by `spec::can_launch_with_prompt()`: `AgentSpec::launch_prompt_verified` (all but copilot) and a prompt under `MAX_LAUNCH_PROMPT_BYTES` (128 KiB). A **same-agent** advance cannot use it (process already running → typed lane). `create_window` nests inside `sh -c '…'` so a prompt there is quoted twice (`single_quote()` in `src/tmux/operations.rs` is the second layer; the switch path types into a running shell — one level). `resolve_skill_command(collapse: false)` keeps `{task}` paragraphs; `spec::normalize_prompt()` strips control chars. `setup_task_worktree` returns `(target, launched_with_prompt)`; callers skip the send when true.

**Mid-session lane** — `send_skill_and_prompt()`, three paths:
1. **opencode** — its picker strips arguments typed all at once. Send bare command name → wait for picker → Enter → send args → Enter.
2. **gemini / codex / cursor / antigravity / pi** — skill + prompt combined into a single message via **bracketed paste** (`paste_text`) + one Enter.
3. **everything else** (claude, copilot, grok) — generic `match (skill_cmd, prompt_trigger)` using `send_keys`, waiting on `prompt_triggers`.

**Submitting** — a bare skill command (a phase with no `{task}`, i.e. `review`) opens the composer's picker on the paste, consuming the first Enter. `submit_message()` watches the composer (presses Enter until the text is gone from the bottom `COMPOSER_TAIL_LINES`, window 14, bounded by `SUBMIT_ATTEMPTS`). Paths 1 and 2 go through `deliver_message()` (resends while the pane is unchanged, 3 attempts × 2s, stops on redraw). `clear_context_on_advance` applies before all three, only for Claude.

**tmux send primitives** (pick by what you send, not interchangeable):

| Method | tmux | Use for |
|---|---|---|
| `paste_text` | `load-buffer` + `paste-buffer -p` | a whole message; bracketed, atomic, newlines literal |
| `send_text` | `send-keys -l --` | literal text; no key-name lookup |
| `send_key` | `send-keys` (no `-l`) | key names — `Enter`, `C-c`, dialog answers |
| `send_keys` | `send-keys` + `Enter` | text plus a submit, generic path |

Without `-l`, tmux resolves an argument matching a key name as that key. `send_key` must never carry task-derived text.

### Typing into a Task Pane
The third lane — keys forwarded from an open task popup (the only lane a human waits on).

```text
crossterm key event → popup_key_input() (Char → Text, else → Key)
  → PaneInputSink::send (enqueue only, never waits for tmux; bounded channel 1024)
  → one broker thread (the single ordering authority)
      ├─ coalesces adjacent Text for the same target (only while more is queued)
      ├─ flushes before every Key, Paste, target change, popup close, shutdown
      ├─► control backend  `tmux -C attach-session`   (persistent, opt-in)
      └─► subprocess backend  `tmux send-keys`         (default, and fallback)
  popup refresh thread → PaneInputSink::capture (same queue: flush, then capture-pane + display -p)
  → ShellPopup.cached_content (drawn next frame)
```

- **No key is a process** — enqueueing is free; delivery rides a persistent control connection. **`PaneInput` is typed** — text goes out with `send-keys -l`, a key without it. **Batching never delays a key** — Enter/Escape/arrows/modified flush and go immediately; buffered text flushes as soon as the queue is empty (`DEFAULT_BATCH_WINDOW` bounds a genuine backlog). A target change flushes.
- **The control connection is on, no config field.** A failed connect / lost connection falls back to subprocess (`maybe_connect`/`drop_control`); `AGTX_TMUX_CONTROL=0` / `AGTX_TMUX_PUSH=0` turn off control / capture-push for one run. `tmux -C` attaches with `-f ignore-size,no-output`; targets must name their own session — `pane_target` guarantees `session:window`, or a bare target after a project switch hits the wrong session.
- **`tmux_quote` is not `single_quote`** — control mode parses tmux syntax (inside double quotes tmux replaces `$VAR`, `#{format}`, leading `~`, backslashes; `\ " $ # ~` escaped; a raw newline cannot be sent). **A failed control write is not replayed** (ambiguous) — dropped, connection marked dead, next request → subprocess. A full queue warns rather than reordering.
- **The popup's pane capture rides the same connection** (a `Capture` request, so it shows keys typed before it). The broker declines with no control connection (`capture_pane_for_popup` is the fallback); a failed capture keeps a healthy connection. Both commands in one round trip; `trim_content_to_cursor` returns the cursor's line index carried by `ShellPopup::cursor_line`; `FrameParser` closes a block only on a matching `%end` command id.
- **A pane with no tmux scrollback delegates scroll keys to the agent** (full-screen agents live on the alternate screen, `history_size` 0). `ShellPopup::has_scrollback()` switches to `handle_popup_scroll`; chords translated (`C-n/p` → PageUp/Down, `C-g` → End). Claude takes the alternate screen shortly after startup.
- **Pane input is never logged.** The broker's ordering authority covers popup input only; agtx's own writes go through `TmuxOperations` on their own threads.

### First-Launch Dialogs
Agents gate an unseen directory behind a dialog. `LAUNCH_DIALOGS` (`src/tui/app.rs`, from `AgentSpec::dialogs`); `dismiss_launch_dialog` answers what it is allowed to.

Mostly these do not fire (see `src/agent/trust.rs`): trust is inherited from the project root for claude/codex/gemini; cursor/grok launch with `--trust`, pi with `--approve`; **antigravity** matches trusted paths exactly (agtx seeds each worktree into `trustedWorkspaces` when the root is trusted). **`AgentDialog::security` splits the table** — trust/bypass prompts are the user's decision: with `auto_trust = false` (default) agtx detects them (card → `Blocked` with reason + fix) and leaves them unanswered; non-safety prompts are answered. An argv prompt is queued behind a dialog, not eaten; `wait_for_agent_ready` returns `None` when parked on an unanswered security dialog. `auto_trust = true` restores historical behaviour (docker/benchmark). Dialogs are matched against the running agent's own entries; `answer` is a key *sequence*.

| Agent | Dialog | Match | Answer | Scope |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| claude | workspace trust | `Yes, I trust this folder` | `1` `Enter` | Launch |
| claude | bypass-permissions | `Yes, I accept` / `I accept the risk` | `2` `Enter` | Launch — backstop |
| codex | directory trust | `Do you trust the contents of this directory?` | `1` `Enter` | Launch |
| codex | update prompt | `Update now (runs` | `2` `Enter` (Skip) | Launch |
| codex | hook review | `Hooks need review` | `3` `Enter` (Continue) | Launch |
| codex | MCP tool approval | `Allow the` + `MCP server to run tool` + `Always allow` | `3` `Enter` | Session |
| gemini | folder trust | `Do you trust the files in this folder?` | `1` `Enter` | Launch — answering restarts |
| cursor | workspace trust | `Workspace Trust Required` | `a` alone | Launch — matched on heading |
| antigravity | project trust | `Do you trust the contents of this project?` | `Enter` alone | Launch — preselected |

`require_all` distinguishes alternatives (wordings of one prompt) from conjunctions (a combination). `security` marks rows agtx will not answer unless `auto_trust`. Runs in both `wait_for_agent_ready` loops and the session-refresh loop; a retry only happens while the pane is unchanged. Some prompts must stay unanswered but declared (gemini's OAuth continue).

### Session Persistence
Tmux window stays open when moving Running → Review. Resume from Review changes status back to Running (window already exists) — no special resume logic.

### Self-Update
agtx tells the user when a newer release exists and replaces its own binary on request.

```
startup → background thread → curl api.github.com/…/releases/latest
  → cache 24h → ~/.config/agtx/update.json
  → mpsc → event loop try_recv → header "⬆ 0.2.8 [u]" → [u] popup → install_release()
```

- The binary knows its own version via `env!("CARGO_PKG_VERSION")`; `release.yml`'s *Tag matches Cargo.toml* step fails the build on drift. `--version`/`-V`/`version` and `update` are in the early fast path in `main.rs`. Cache: 24h TTL, still served offline; path from `GlobalConfig::config_path()`'s parent. `curl`, not an HTTP crate (`src/update/github.rs`). Failure is always a missing notice, never an error.
- **The swap**: `rename(target, target.old)` → `rename(new, target)` → unlink, staged inside the target's own directory (same-filesystem; renaming over a running binary is legal on Unix). Replacing in place keeps worktrees valid (the absolute `agtx` path is baked into every hook command + MCP config). A package-managed binary (`/nix/store/…`, Homebrew) is refused. Never automatic — opt out with `update_check = false` or `AGTX_NO_UPDATE_CHECK=1`.
- **Three files must agree on artifact naming** — `src/update/release.rs`, `install.sh`, `release.yml`; `tests/update_tests.rs` greps and asserts. `release.yml` publishes `<archive>.sha256`; `install.sh` verifies it.

### Serving the Board to a Phone
`agtx serve` (feature = `serve`) is the MCP server re-exposed over HTTP with a PWA — talks to SQLite/tmux/git, never to `App`. `W` runs it as a child and shows the pairing QR.

- **Actions queue; they do not execute.** A tap writes to `transition_requests`; only a running TUI drains it. Every action response says `queued`, carries `tui_connected`, phone shows a banner when nothing drains.
- **Loopback needs no credential; anything wider does** (off-loopback, including a tunnel, needs a paired device — `ServeOptions::is_loopback` reads the tunnel too). **Per-device tokens, hashed at rest** in `mobile_devices`; `--revoke` is immediate + cross-process.
- **Serving is per-session; the pairing is not.** A pairing outlives the server (device row in global `index.db`, token in the phone's `localStorage`); revocation is manual. Secrets reach the phone in the URL fragment; `/ws` uses `Sec-WebSocket-Protocol`. Auth in the router middleware, not the socket handler.
- **No bundler** (plain ES modules via `include_bytes!` — a missing file is a compile error). **No xterm.js** (`capture-pane -p -e` emits only `ESC[…m`; `web/ansi.js` builds a DOM fragment so `<script>` is text). **ratatui does not interpret ANSI** — the `W` overlay uses `qr::grid` + styled spans, `qr::render` is the CLI banner. **The board does not poll** — fetched when something happened; the live pane keeps its socket, sends only changed frames.

### Database Storage
Databases stored centrally in the platform data dir (`GlobalConfig::data_dir`, via `directories`): macOS `~/Library/Application Support/agtx/`, Linux `~/.local/share/agtx/`. Config paths split across two roots: `GlobalConfig::config_path()` builds from `$HOME`, so `config.toml`/`plugins/`/`logs/` are always at `$HOME/.config/agtx/`; `TrustStore::path()` uses `directories`' `config_dir()`, so `trusted_projects.toml` follows the platform. On first run a `config.toml` at the old location is migrated. Structure: `index.db` (global project index), `projects/{hash}.db` (per-project, hash of project path).

### Tmux Architecture
Dedicated tmux server named `agtx` (`tmux -L agtx`). Each project gets its own session (named after project); each task gets its own window in that session. Separate from the user's regular tmux. View: `tmux -L agtx list-windows -a`; attach: `tmux -L agtx attach`.

### Orchestrator Agent (Experimental)
A dedicated Claude Code agent that autonomously manages the board. Enabled with `--experimental`, toggled with `O`.

```
Orchestrator (Claude Code) ←MCP stdio→ MCP Server (agtx mcp-serve) ←SQLite→ DB
Orchestrator → TUI: transition_requests table.  TUI → Orchestrator: notifications (send_keys when idle)
```

- MCP registered per-session via `claude mcp add-json --scope local` as **`agtx-orchestrator`** (not `agtx`, avoids config conflict), cleaned up on exit. Only Claude implements `build_orchestrator_command()`. Manages Planning/Running; the user triages Backlog/Research and handles merging. A coordinator, not a reviewer. Only "completed phase" notifications sent; on startup an existing session is reconnected with catch-up notifications (deduped via `peek_notifications`).

**MCP tools**:
- Discovery: `list_projects` (global mode only), `get_config` (global + project merged — the only way a caller learns `auto_trust`; carries both file paths).
- Read: `list_tasks`, `get_task` (includes `allowed_actions`), `wait_for_board_change`, `get_transition_status`, `check_conflicts`, `get_notifications`, `read_pane_content`. `list_tasks`/`get_task` carry `phase_status` + `phase_age_secs` + `tui_connected`. `list_tasks` returns `{tui_connected, tasks: [...]}`, omits descriptions unless `include_description` is set. `read_pane_content` returns a real tail (`pane_tail`) via `capture-pane -S -N`.
- Write: `move_task` (queues a transition request; actions `research`, `move_forward`, `move_to_planning`, `move_to_running`, `move_to_review`, `move_to_done`, `move_to_done_and_merge`, `resume`, `escalate_to_user`), `send_to_task` (Planning/Running/Review, 4096-byte cap; bracketed paste + watched submit). `resume` runs the task round a whole execute cycle.
- CRUD (Backlog only for update/delete): `create_task`, `create_tasks_batch` (max 50, index-based `depends_on`), `update_task`, `delete_task`.

**Phase status (`task_runtime`)** — how a non-TUI process learns a phase's status; published only while someone is reading (`board_watch`, 10-min window), marked by the web server on a board request and the MCP server on `list_tasks`/`get_task` (throttled 30s). Not gated on `serve`. Read `phase_status` against `phase_age_secs`, never alone (large age = nothing watching). `phase_status` is the TUI's verdict (all agents, the only signal that can say `ready`/`exited`); `agent_state` is the agent's own report (hooks, 5 of 8). `tui_connected` reads `tui_heartbeat` via `Database::tui_is_live` (6s window) — without it a frozen row reads as live.

**`wait_for_board_change`** replaces a poll loop: blocks inside the server, re-reading every `WAIT_POLL_INTERVAL`, answers once with only the tasks that differ from what this session was last shown, and carries the outcome of every queued `move_task`. Timeout defaults `DEFAULT_WAIT_SECS`, capped `MAX_WAIT_SECS` (a timeout is an answer). What wakes it is narrower than what changed — a state that needs the caller (`ready`/`idle`/`blocked`/`exited`, Done, a startable Backlog task, an escalation), appears/vanishes, a failed transition, a `tui_connected` flip (`TaskMark::needs_attention`); `working` and an absent phase status do not. Per session (`AgtxMcpServer::boards`; pure half `src/mcp/board_watch.rs`). Two maps (last reported + last poll); `turn_ts` tells two `idle`s apart. `async`.

**When a phase counts as done** (`ready` = safe to advance/merge/resume):
- Artifact written during this phase — `Task::phase_entered_at` stamped by `Database::update_task` on any status change; `phase_artifact_fresh` counts an artifact only if mtime ≥ that stamp. `phase_artifact_exists` stays for gating callers.
- A verdict applies only to the status it was computed for — `apply_session_refresh` drops one describing the previous phase; `TaskRuntime::status` records what each row was computed for.
- The turn must be over — `gate_ready_on_turn` holds a fresh artifact at `working` while the hook reports `working`/`blocked` (a silent `working` stops being trusted after `HOOK_STALE_SECS`).

`send_to_task` goes through `core::input::send_user_text` (bracketed paste + watched submit), not raw `send-keys` (a large typed burst has its head silently dropped by the agent).

**Serialized worktree setup** — one at a time (`setup_rx` is a single slot). Everything starting a Backlog task goes through `setup_queue` carrying a `SetupIntent` (the dependency overlay lets each plugin choose research vs planning via `PluginDefault`; an MCP request names one transition). A queued MCP request stays claimed + unprocessed (`get_transition_status` → `pending`) until the drain starts it; every way the drain declines resolves it with an error. Claims are reclaimed after `RECLAIM_CLAIMS_AFTER` (5 min, `Database::reclaim_stale_transition_requests`); `cleanup_old_transition_requests` deletes abandoned ones after an hour.

**`move_to_done_and_merge`** — merges the branch into its base in the project's own checkout, then Done (`allowed_actions` offers it to `Orchestrator`, not `Human`). `git::merge_task_branch` merges only when the checkout is on the base branch with no *tracked* modifications, else `Refused`. **Every route to Done must appear in the uncommitted-changes guard** (Done deletes the worktree; `has_changes` counts untracked; `every_route_to_done_refuses_a_worktree_with_uncommitted_work` iterates all three). An empty branch is refused (`commits_ahead` checked first; `MergeOutcome::NothingToMerge`). A conflict leaves the task in Review, sets `escalation_note`, sends `/agtx:merge-conflicts` (the virtual merge `check_merge_conflicts` runs first; `merge_branch` runs `git merge --abort` on failure).

**Incremental re-review** — the `resume` path writes HEAD to `.agtx/reviewed-at` (`mark_reviewed_point`). The review skill: present → `<marker>..HEAD` plus prior `.agtx/review.md`; absent → whole branch. The marker is a commit, so the skill pairs the range with **`git status --short`** (not `git diff HEAD`, which omits untracked files).

### MCP Server Modes
| Mode | Command | Used by |
|------|---------|---------|
| Project-scoped | `agtx mcp-serve <path>` | Orchestrator (bound to one project) |
| Global | `agtx mcp-serve` | Sweep and oneshot skills, ad-hoc sessions |

In global mode all CRUD tools require a `project_id` (call `list_projects` first); project-scoped ignores it. `ServerMode` enum in `src/mcp/server.rs`; resolution via `resolve_project_path(project_id)`.

### General Configuration
Global config at `~/.config/agtx/config.toml` (`GlobalConfig`):
```toml
default_agent = "claude"
fullscreen_on_enter = false  # Enter opens the task's tmux pane fullscreen inside agtx
agent_hooks = true           # Write agent lifecycle-hook configs into worktrees
auto_trust = false           # Answer agents' trust / bypass-permission prompts by reading the pane
update_check = true          # Daily GitHub release check + header notice

[agents]                     # Per-phase instance overrides (PhaseAgentsConfig)
research = "claude"
planning = "claude"
running = "codex"
review = "omp-review"

[agent_profiles.omp-review]  # Named instance; schema is generic
agent = "omp"                # Base identity used for specs/plugins/hooks
profile = "review"           # Optional adapter-specific selector
model = "provider/model"     # Optional adapter-specific selector; bypasses routing

[model_routing]               # Optional Jev phase-entry router
api_key_env = "TYPESAFE_API_KEY"
[model_routing.phases.planning]
fallback = "high"
minimum = "high"
[model_routing.models.claude]
standard = "sonnet"
high = "opus"

[worktree]                   # WorktreeConfig
enabled = true
auto_cleanup = true
base_branch = ""             # empty = auto-detect main/master
worktree_dir = ".agtx/worktrees"
branch_prefix = "task"       # "task" → task/{slug}
```

### Project Configuration
Per-project overrides at `{project}/.agtx/config.toml` (`ProjectConfig`), merged over global via `MergedConfig::merge`:

| Field | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `default_agent`, `agents` | Global fallback / per-phase named-instance overrides |
| `agent_profiles` | Named instance → base agent with optional profile/model; project entries replace same-named global entries |
| `model_routing` | Optional Jev phase/tier policy and base-harness model map; project section replaces global |
| `base_branch` | Branch worktrees are cut from |
| `github_url` | Repo URL for PR operations |
| `worktree_dir` | Where worktrees are created |
| `copy_files` | Comma-separated files copied into worktrees |
| `init_script` / `cleanup_script` | Shell commands run after creation / before removal |
| `workflow_plugin` | Active plugin for new tasks |
| `branch_prefix` | Branch name prefix |
| `skip_worktree` | Work directly in the project root |

Agent precedence is explicit phase instance → task wizard fallback → global default. `Task::agent`
tracks the active instance, `Task::base_agent` stores the wizard fallback, and
`Task::session_agents` stores immutable launch snapshots by instance name. Adapters with
`AgentSpec::session_dir_flag` also snapshot a task-and-instance-specific conversation directory (OMP's
verified `--session-dir` implementation), so same-base aliases cannot both resume the pane's latest
conversation. Do not use the instance name for plugin compatibility, skills, hooks, readiness, or
lifecycle behavior; resolve those from the snapshot/configured base identity.

Model routing is phase-entry only. Resolution is fixed profile model → Jev capability tier →
`model_routing.models.<base-agent>` model. The TUI writes an owner-only request under
`AGTX_DATA_DIR/model-routes`, and command composition invokes the early `agtx model-route` CLI in a
quoted shell substitution for both launch and resume. The helper persists one decision, scrubs the
prompt, prints only the model on stdout, and fails open to the concrete fallback. Keep API keys out
of snapshots: requests store only the environment-variable name. Only harnesses with a verified
`AgentSpec::model_flag` may route.

### Project Trust
`init_script`, `cleanup_script`, `copy_files`, and `model_routing` are stripped from an untrusted project's config at startup (`App::new`) with a warning banner. Trust is a **canonical path → SHA-256 of `.agtx/config.toml`** map in `TrustStore` (`trusted_projects.toml`); editing the config invalidates trust. A project with no `.agtx/config.toml` is trusted by default. An untrusted project also forces `flags.no_init_scripts = true`. Approve via the in-TUI popup (any key) or `agtx trust`.

**agtx's own writes re-record trust** — any write to `.agtx/config.toml` (`P`, config editor save) changes the hash. `TrustStore::retrust_after_agtx_write` restores the *prior* decision, gated on the trust state read **before** the write. `TrustStore::path()`/`GlobalConfig::config_path()` honour `AGTX_CONFIG_DIR`; `Database::data_root` honours `AGTX_DATA_DIR`. `--no-init-scripts` suppresses scripts regardless of trust.

### Help Overlay
`?` opens `tui::help`'s table: every binding, grouped, scrollable, closed with `?`/`Esc`/`q`. **`HELP` is the complete list**; `build_footer_text` shows only column-specific actions plus `[?] help`/`[q] quit` (one line; `every_footer_fits_a_narrow_terminal` caps every variant at 120 chars). Scrolls with the same chords as a task pane (`scroll_action_for` table). Two columns where wide enough (`help::columns(n)` balances but never splits a section). `help_max_scroll` is a `Cell` the renderer writes.

### First Run
No separate flow. `main.rs` writes the default config, sets `FeatureFlags::first_run`; the TUI opens the **config editor** focused on `Default agent` (`open_first_run_editor`). `new_for_test_with_flags` calls the same path.

### Config Editor
`,` opens `~/.config/agtx/config.toml` and the project's `.agtx/config.toml` as a form (`src/tui/config_editor.rs`). Sections across the top (General / Agents / Worktree / Theme, plus Project), fields below. `config_editor_area` sizes the box to its content across all sections, clamped to the terminal.

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `h/l` or `Tab`/`S-Tab` | Move between sections |
| `j/k` or arrows | Move between fields |
| `Enter` / `Space` | Toggle, or open the field for editing |
| `Enter` / `Esc` in an open field | Accept / abandon that field only |
| `C-s` | Save |
| `Esc` | Close (asks first if there are unsaved changes) |

**Fields are declared, not open-coded** — one `FieldId`, exactly two matches (`read`/`write`); `every_field_round_trips_through_read_and_write` walks the form. Opens on the files, not on `state.config` (a merged view would bake global defaults into the project file). `dirty` tracks what is stored. A save re-records trust (read state before the write). A bad colour is refused and the field stays open; theme edits preview live (global-only), closing without saving reloads from disk.

### Config Writes Preserve Comments
`GlobalConfig::save` / `ProjectConfig::save` go through `write_toml_preserving` (`src/config/mod.rs`), not `toml::to_string_pretty` (which drops comments and unrecognised keys). Rule: *agtx rewrites the values of keys it knows, never deletes a key it does not recognise, removes a key it manages when unset.* `expand_inline_tables` normalises serde's inline `worktree = { .. }` to a `[worktree]` section; `remove_key_keeping_comments` moves a removed first key's comment to the next key; `GLOBAL_MANAGED`/`PROJECT_MANAGED` name the keys a save may delete (`managed_keys_tests` uses an exhaustive struct literal). An unparseable file is replaced rather than erroring.

### Theme Configuration
Colors configurable via `~/.config/agtx/config.toml`:
```toml
[theme]
color_selected = "#ead49a"      # Selected elements (yellow)
color_normal = "#5cfff7"        # Normal borders (cyan)
color_dimmed = "#9C9991"        # Inactive elements (dark gray)
color_text = "#f2ece6"          # Text (light rose)
color_accent = "#5cfff7"        # Accents (cyan)
color_description = "#C4B0AC"   # Task descriptions (dimmed rose)
color_column_header = "#a0d2fa" # Column headers (light blue gray)
color_popup_border = "#9ffcf8"  # Popup borders (light cyan)
color_popup_header = "#69fae7"  # Popup headers (light cyan)
```

| `Esc` | Cancel |

### Task Creation Wizard
Flow: **Title → Agent → Plugin → Prompt**. Both middle steps are optional and drop out when there is nothing to choose (one installed agent, or one compatible plugin), so `steps()` is derived.

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `j/k` or arrows | Navigate a list step |
| `/` | Filter the list |
| `Tab` | Cycle through options |
| `Enter` | Advance to next step / save |
| `Esc` | Cancel the wizard, from any step |
| `S-Tab` / `C-b` | Step back one step |
| `C-s` | Save from any step |
| `\` + Enter (or `C-j`, `Alt+Enter`) | Newline in the prompt |

`WizardState` (`src/tui/wizard.rs`) is the whole flow as one value (step, both text fields, both list picks, edited task id) — holding every field makes back-navigation work.

- **The agent step writes `Task::base_agent`**, which stands in for `default_agent` when a phase's agent is resolved (`phase_agent`: a phase's own `[agents]` entry wins, else the task's pick, else the default). It is a column of its own, not `Task::agent` (which names what runs now). A `NULL` row resolves to the configured default; the migration backfills only for Backlog tasks with no session. The plugin list is filtered by the settled agent (`reseed_plugins_for_agent`); `try_save_wizard` rebuilds too.
- `ListPick` is one type for both list steps; `selected` indexes `options`, not the filtered view; `settle()` moves it only when the filter excludes it. A filter belongs to the visit, not the step. Each step seeds itself once (`take_seed`/`take_prompt_seed`). `steps()` is derived; `step_index` is a position in *this* flow.
- **`Esc` cancels outright**; stepping back is `Shift+Tab`/`Ctrl+B`. Two things own `Esc` first — a prompt-step dropdown, and an open list filter.
- **`Enter` saves; a newline needs an escape**: `\`+Enter (documented), `Ctrl+J` (crossterm parses `0x0A` as `Ctrl+J` in raw mode), `Alt+Enter`. **`Shift+Enter` is deliberately not bound and agtx does not request the Kitty protocol** (a terminal sends bare CR for both unless negotiated; `supports_keyboard_enhancement()` blocks up to 2s). `Ctrl+J` overlaps the pickers' down-arrow and collides with `vim-tmux-navigator`.
- **A chord is not text** — `TextInput::handle_edit_key` and all three dropdowns guard `Char(c)` on `!ctrl && !alt`. Under the Kitty protocol `Shift+Tab` arrives as `Tab`+`SHIFT`, not `BackTab` (both accepted).
- `AppState.wizard: Option<WizardState>` **is** the input mode; `wizard_step()` is the one accessor. A refusal is never silent — `title_problem()` is the single source for `Enter` on the title step and `C-s` (empty / too long / duplicate); a failure walks back to the title step and renders the reason in the wizard body. The renderer is a real `Layout` (`draw_wizard`). The prompt step's `#`/`@`, `/`, `!` dropdowns are each their own handler (`handle_file_search_key`/`handle_skill_search_key`/`handle_task_ref_search_key`), each takes its state out, all commit/cancel through `splice_search_region`.

### Task Edit (Description)
| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `#` or `@` | Start file search (fuzzy find) |
| `/` | Start skill search (at start of line or after space) |
| `!` | Start task reference search (at start of line or after space) |
| `\` + Enter (or `C-j`, `Alt+Enter`) | Newline (multi-line) |
| Arrow keys | Move cursor |
| `Alt+Left/Right` or `Alt+b/f` | Word-by-word navigation |
| `Home/End` | Jump to start/end |

## Code Patterns

### Comments and Docs
**Describe the code as it is: keep the reasoning and the measurements, drop the chronology.** Say what a guard prevents, not what once went wrong; name the alternative, not the predecessor. `used to`/`no longer`/`previously`/`the old X` usually signal a lapse (but each has a legitimate present-tense sense — read the line).

### Ratatui TUI
- `crossterm` backend. State separated from terminal for the borrow checker: `App { terminal, state: AppState }`. Drawing functions are static: `fn draw_*(state: &AppState, frame: &mut Frame, area: Rect)`. Theme colors via `state.config.theme.color_*`.
- **Every text field uses `tui::text_input::TextInput`** (buffer + caret as one value; motion/deletion/word-jumps behind `handle_edit_key`, which *reports* whether it consumed the key rather than swallowing it). `Enter`/`Esc` are not handled there. The caret is a **byte** offset — every motion goes through the module's boundary helpers. `wrapped_cursor_pos` stays beside `wrap_spans` in `app.rs` (shared wrap rule).

### Error Handling
`anyhow::Result` for all fallible functions; `.context()` for context. Gracefully handle missing tmux sessions/worktrees.

### Database
SQLite via `rusqlite` (`bundled`). Migrations via `ALTER TABLE ... ADD COLUMN` (ignores errors if column exists). DateTime as RFC3339 strings.

### The Event Loop
`App::run` **blocks** on one `mpsc` channel two threads feed, and draws only when something changed.

```text
agtx-terminal-input ─┐   blocking event::read()
                     ├─► mpsc<Wake> ─► run(): recv_timeout(HOUSEKEEPING_TICK)
agtx-pane-watch ─────┘        ├─ draw, if anything set `dirty`
   captures the open popup's  └─ housekeeping, on its own tick
   pane, sends only when CHANGED
```

- **Echo latency** is the pane watcher's cadence. It learns a pane painted two ways: **push** — a second control client attached without `no-output` (`OutputWatch`), open only while a popup is, whose `%output` says which pane painted (`SHELL_REFRESH_INTERVAL` becomes a rate limit; `PANE_OUTPUT_MIN_INTERVAL` paces agent output, `PANE_TYPING_WINDOW` keeps the fast cadence after a keystroke); **poll** — the timer when push is unavailable. Either way the watcher compares and wakes the loop only on a difference. Capture depth follows the scroll position — `SHELL_POPUP_TAIL_LINES` (100) at the bottom, `SHELL_POPUP_CAPTURE_LINES` (500) once scrolled up (`popup_capture_depth`). `PANE_PUSH_BACKSTOP` is the net.
- **Housekeeping** (`maybe_spawn_session_refresh`, expiring warnings, the MCP transition queue) runs on `HOUSEKEEPING_TICK`; its SQLite query has its own `TRANSITION_POLL_INTERVAL` (phase status is only as fresh as `PHASE_STATUS_CACHE_TTL`). **Drawing** happens when `dirty` was set; `REDRAW_BACKSTOP` is a safety net, not the mechanism. **Nothing on the board animates** (`Working` is a static `▶`; `nothing_on_the_board_animates` fails if a spinner appears). A closing window is pushed, not polled (`%window-close` → `InputConfig::window_events`). The poll fallback backs off to `PANE_IDLE_INTERVAL` after `PANE_IDLE_ROUNDS`; a keystroke pokes it back.

### Background Operations
PR description generation, PR creation, and phase status polling run in background threads. Results come back over `mpsc`, collected by `pump_background_results()` on each wake-up (non-blocking `try_recv`).

### Phase Status Polling
`maybe_spawn_session_refresh()` spawns a background thread (2s cache TTL per task) covering Planning/Running/Review plus Backlog tasks with an active research session. **Its tmux work is per pass, not per task** — one `list-windows -a` answers `window_exists` for every task (`live_window_targets`); each pane captured once over the control connection (`capture_pane_text` → `CaptureSpec::text()` — no `-e`, so no SGR escapes in a dialog's wording), shared by the dialog scan and content hash. `window_is_gone` fails safe (unreadable listing = unknown); overlap guard: one refresh thread at a time. `apply_session_refresh()` applies on the main thread; idle detection (Working → Idle) via `pane_content_hashes` timestamps, only for tasks with no hook report. Five states (`PhaseStatus`): Working, Blocked (agent-reported only), Idle (15s no output), Ready, Exited.

### Hook-Based Phase Status
Agents that support lifecycle hooks report their own state instead of agtx guessing from pane output. `agtx hook --env <agent>` writes `{worktree}/.agtx/status/{task_id}.json`, read by the refresh thread.

**Five of eight agents report their own state.** Every one takes a **project-local** hook config (removing the worktree removes the registration). `write_hook_config()` is the writer, selected by `AgentSpec::hook_config` (`HookConfigKind`); `None` (keep the pane-hash heuristic) is a supported state.

| Agent | Config file | Handler shape | Payload event key | Can report `Blocked` |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| claude | `.claude/settings.local.json` | `{hooks:[{type,command}]}` | `hook_event_name`, PascalCase | yes — `PermissionRequest`, `Notification` |
| gemini | `.gemini/settings.json` | same | `hook_event_name`, PascalCase | yes — `Notification` |
| cursor | `.cursor/hooks.json` | flat `{command}` | `hook_event_name`, camelCase | no |
| grok | `.grok/hooks/agtx.json` | `{hooks:[{type,command}]}` | `hookEventName`, snake_case value | yes — `Notification` scoped to `permission_prompt` |
| antigravity | `.agents/hooks.json` | keyed by hook *name*, then event | none — passed as `--event` | no |
| codex | `.codex/hooks.json` | `{description, hooks:{…}}` | `hook_event_name`, PascalCase | mapped, **not deployed** |
| opencode, copilot, pi | — | — | — | no hooks |

The formats are **not interchangeable**, and every mismatch fails silently (a valid-looking config, no status file written) — this is why `tests/smoke/agent_smoke.py` is the gate. Notes: cursor takes a flat list; grok reports `pre_tool_use` for `PreToolUse` (both map via `squash()`; camelCase keys need serde aliases); antigravity's `PreToolUse` is not subscribable (`PostToolUse` carries the heartbeat); codex's `hooks` key in `.codex/config.toml` is a table, not a path. **Codex is off, deliberately** — a project-local `.codex/hooks.json` triggers a startup review that would trust every hook the repo ships (the vocabulary is mapped and the writer exists — one field to enable).

- **Writers merge where the file is shared** — `merge_claude_hooks()` keeps user entries, replaces only agtx's own (matched on `" hook --env"`); `write_hook_config` runs **after** `write_mcp_config`. The hook command is task-agnostic; the task comes from `AGTX_TASK_ID`/`AGTX_WORKTREE` set on the tmux **window** by `create_window` (tmux `-e`); exits silently when absent. `--event <Name>` supplies the event for an agent whose payload carries none (antigravity).
- **`hook_events(kind)` and `map_hook_event(kind, …)` are two halves of one contract** (same file, both directions asserted). `src/agent/hook_status.rs` is pure (event mapping, atomic write-then-rename, staleness, `merge_event`'s guard against a late `PreToolUse` clearing a fresh `Blocked`). Claude's `Notification` is scoped to `permission_prompt` (unscoped a finished turn would report Blocked immediately).
- **Precedence** in the refresh thread: fresh artifact with the turn over → `Ready` > window gone → `Exited` > hook status > pane-hash heuristic. **Purely additive** — no status file → the 15s pane-hash heuristic runs unchanged; a `working` record older than `HOOK_STALE_SECS` (300s) is distrusted. **Consumers**: an agent-reported `Blocked` fires the orchestrator stuck-task notification *immediately*, `Idle` keeps its 60s settle; a trust-blocked task is excluded. The merge-conflict trigger fires on `Ready`/`Idle` only.
- **Binary-path drift**: the absolute `agtx` path is baked into the hook command + every MCP config. `write_skills_to_worktree` records the deploying binary in `.agtx/deployed-by`; `refresh_stale_worktree_configs` re-deploys mismatched worktrees at startup. **Not wired**: codex, opencode (TypeScript plugin API), copilot (support *unknown*).

### Task References & Dependencies
- Type `!` in description input (start of line or after space) to search tasks; selecting inserts `![task-title]` and tracks the ID (stored comma-separated in `task.referenced_tasks`). References double as **dependencies** — `Database::deps_satisfied` returns true only when every referenced task is in Review or Done; starting research or moving a Backlog task forward is blocked until then.
- `src/tui/dep_graph.rs` builds a topologically-leveled `DepGraph` (level 0 = no in-graph deps; a node is `unblocked` when in Backlog with satisfied deps). The `D` overlay renders it and can batch-move; free of ratatui/DB types (caller passes a `deps_satisfied` closure). MCP `create_tasks_batch` wires the same deps via 0-based `depends_on` indices.
- At worktree setup, referenced tasks' artifacts are copied to `.agtx/references/` (git diffs `{slug}.diff`, worktree files `.agtx/skills/`/`.planning/` if the referenced worktree still exists).

### Auto Merge-Conflict Resolution
During `apply_session_refresh`, Review tasks are checked against the default branch using `git merge-tree --write-tree` (Git 2.38+, non-destructive). Triggers when a Review task becomes **newly Ready** or has been **Idle 30+ seconds**; sends `/agtx:merge-conflicts` skill + prompt to the agent. One-shot per task (`merge_conflict_checked: HashSet<String>`). Works with all plugins (the skill is a builtin deployed to every worktree). The skill: commit current work → merge origin/main → resolve conflicts → review only conflicted files against both parents → run tests.

### Agent Integration
- Every per-agent value is one field of that agent's `AgentSpec` in `src/agent/spec.rs`; functions read the table rather than matching on the agent's name. Agents spawned via `build_interactive_command()` in `src/agent/mod.rs`. Flags: Claude `--dangerously-skip-permissions`, Codex `--sandbox workspace-write`, Gemini `GEMINI_TRUST_WORKSPACE=true` + `--approval-mode yolo`, Copilot `--allow-all-tools`, Cursor `agent --yolo`, Grok `--yolo --trust`, Antigravity `agy --dangerously-skip-permissions --mode accept-edits`.
- `build_resume_command()` is the recovery variant after a restart — mostly `--continue` appended (`ResumeArgs::Append`), but Gemini uses `--resume` and Codex's `resume --last` *replaces* the flags (`ResumeArgs::Replace`).
- `tests/agent_parity_tests.rs` pins every string per agent (written against behaviour). Commands resolved per-task via `resolve_skill_command()`; prompts via `resolve_prompt()` (pure template substitution).

## Building & Testing

```bash
cargo build --release
cargo test
cargo test --features test-mocks

# Per-agent smoke tests — real binaries, real auth (opt-in, never CI)
tests/smoke/agent_smoke.py
python3 tests/smoke/test_agent_smoke.py

# Real-tmux pane input: ordering, escaping, pane sizing, reconnect, latency (opt-in)
AGTX_TMUX_IT=1 cargo test --test tmux_control_tests -- --nocapture
```

`tmux_control_tests.rs` starts throwaway tmux servers and asserts on the **bytes a program in the pane received**, not rendered output. Run on Linux too (only macOS / tmux 3.5a so far).

The smoke runner answers the one question the Rust suite cannot: **does a real agent binary actually receive its work?** Per phase it asserts the command was *submitted* (not parked in a composer), a marker file carries the **task id** passed in, the artifact appeared and the phase advanced, and the session is still usable. Dialogs are never pre-answered. See `tests/smoke/README.md`.

`cargo run --example agent_matrix` dumps `AGENT_SPECS` + `BUNDLED_PLUGINS` as JSON; the smoke runner reads it and `cargo test` compiles it (a new spec field breaks the build rather than drifting).

Dependencies: recent stable Rust (CI on `stable`, no MSRV pinned), SQLite (bundled), tmux, git, gh CLI (PR operations).

## Common Tasks

### Adding a new task field
1. Add field to `Task` struct in `src/db/models.rs`
2. Add column to schema and migration in `src/db/schema.rs`
3. Update `create_task`, `update_task`, `task_from_row` in schema.rs
4. Update UI rendering in `src/tui/app.rs`

### Adding a new theme color
1. Add field to `ThemeConfig` in `src/config/mod.rs`
2. Add default function and update `Default` impl
3. Use `hex_to_color(&state.config.theme.color_*)` in app.rs

### Adding a new agent
**`src/agent/spec.rs`** — the declarative half
1. Add one `AgentSpec` entry to `AGENT_SPECS`: identity (name, binary, description, git co-author), launching (`env`, `base_args`, `prompt_form`, `resume`, `headless_args`), skills (`skill_dir`, `skill_layout`, `skill_scan_dir`, `command_syntax`). Everything in `mod.rs`, `operations.rs`, `skills.rs` is derived from it.
2. Declare `prompt_form` (`Argv` or `Flag("-i")`) but leave `launch_prompt_verified: false` until checked against the real binary.
3. If no existing `SkillLayout`/`CommandSyntax` variant fits, add **one** variant plus the arm in the single function that reads it — never a new match on the agent's name.

**`tests/agent_parity_tests.rs`**
4. Extend every parity table (`parity_covers_every_known_agent` fails until you do).

**`src/tui/app.rs`** — still per-agent
5. Add the binary to `AGENT_COMMANDS` (pane process detection)
6. Add an activity indicator to `AGENT_ACTIVE_INDICATORS` if it is an Ink/Node TUI (runs inside bash)
7. Add exit command handling in `switch_agent_in_tmux()` (graceful exit cmd or Ctrl+C)
8. Add the skill-deploy branch in **both** `write_skills_to_worktree()` and `deploy_skill()`
9. Add the per-agent MCP config writer in `write_skills_to_worktree()` (format varies)
9b. Set `hook_config`/`hook_event_source` on the spec if it supports hooks; add its `HookConfigKind` arm to `write_hook_config`, `hook_events`, `map_hook_event`, and extend `vocabulary()` in `tests/hook_status_tests.rs`. Leave `hook_config: None` until a real run writes a `.agtx/status/*.json`.
10. Add an agent label color in the task-card footer `match task.agent.as_str()`
11. If Ink/Node TUI: add to the combined-send branch in `send_skill_and_prompt()`; add double-Enter handling if it has a command picker popup

**Plugins**
12. Add the agent to `supported_agents` in any `plugins/*/plugin.toml` that whitelists agents

### Adding a keyboard shortcut
1. Find the appropriate `handle_*_key` function in `src/tui/app.rs`
2. Add match arm for the new key
3. Add it to the `HELP` table in `src/tui/help.rs` (that overlay is the complete list)
4. Only add it to `build_footer_text` if it belongs to the five things you reach for constantly

### Adding a new popup
1. Add state struct (e.g. `MyPopup`) in app.rs
2. Add `Option<MyPopup>` field to `AppState`, initialize to `None` in `App::new()`
3. Add rendering in `draw_board()`
4. Add key handler function `handle_my_popup_key()`
5. Add check in `handle_key()` to route to handler

### Adding a new bundled plugin
1. Create `plugins/<name>/plugin.toml` with commands, prompts, artifacts
2. Add entry to `BUNDLED_PLUGINS` in `src/skills.rs`
3. Optionally add `supported_agents` to restrict agent compatibility

### Adding custom skills to a plugin
1. Create `plugins/<name>/skills/agtx-{phase}/SKILL.md` files (YAML frontmatter: `name: agtx-{phase}`, `description: ...`)
2. Auto-deployed to agent-native paths during worktree setup

## Supported Agents

Detected automatically via `known_agents()` in order of preference:
1. **claude** - Anthropic's Claude Code CLI
2. **codex** - OpenAI's Codex CLI
3. **copilot** - GitHub Copilot CLI
4. **gemini** - Google Gemini CLI
5. **opencode** - AI-powered coding assistant
6. **cursor** - Cursor Agent CLI (binary is `agent`)
7. **grok** - xAI's Grok Build CLI
8. **antigravity** - Google's Antigravity CLI (binary is `agy`)

## Future Enhancements
- Reopen Done tasks (recreate worktree from preserved branch)
- Orchestrator: support non-Claude agents; task deletion notifications; multi-project support

Design notes for in-flight work live in `docs/planning/` (untracked).
