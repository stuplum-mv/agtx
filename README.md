- **Parallel Multi-agent task lifecycle**: Configure different agents per workflow phase — e.g. Grok for research, Claude for implementation, Codex for review — with automatic agent switching and context handover.
- **Multi-project Kanban board**: Manage agent sessions across all projects via a single TUI without leaving your terminal.
- **Vim-native Keybindings**: Control the board and agent sessions with your Vim-powered muscle memory.
- **Mobile support**: Press `W` and scan the QR for an installable web app with the board, task details, diffs and the agent's live terminal — including a keyboard, so you can answer a permission prompt without going back to your desk. Over your wifi, or from anywhere via your tailnet. See <a href="#mobile">Mobile</a>.
- **Orchestrator agent (experimental)**: A dedicated agent that autonomously manages your kanban board via MCP — delegates to coding agents, advances phases, checks for merge conflicts.
- **Oneshot skill**: Give a coding agent session a goal with `/agtx:oneshot` and it runs the whole board unattended — plans the work in milestone waves, starts tasks, unblocks the workers, judges Review, and merges each task. See <a href="#oneshot-skill">Oneshot Skill</a>.
- **Brainstorm & Sweep skills**: Capture ideas and push them to the board from any coding agent session — `/agtx:brainstorm` to explore freely, `/agtx:sweep` to decompose and create tasks with one confirmation step.
- **Spec-driven plugins**: Plug in [GSD](https://github.com/fynnfluegge/get-shit-done-cc), [Spec-kit](https://github.com/github/spec-kit), [OpenSpec](https://github.com/Fission-AI/OpenSpec), [BMAD](https://github.com/bmad-code-org/BMAD-METHOD), [Superpowers](https://github.com/obra/superpowers) and more — fully customizable. Ddefine your own workflow via a single TOML file. See <a href="#plugins">Plugins</a> how to create a plugin.

> [!NOTE]
> Just need a plain coding-agent session-manager with **full human-in-the-loop control** and **no spec-driven skill execution and orchestration** on advancing tasks?
>
> Choose the **`void` plugin** and enjoy agtx as a batteries included multi-agent session-manager.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fynnfluegge/agtx/main/install.sh | bash
```

```bash
# Run in any git repository
cd your-project && agtx
```

> [!NOTE]
> Add `.agtx/` to your project's `.gitignore` to avoid committing worktrees and local task data.

```bash
# Install from source — `serve` adds the mobile board (`W`), and the
# published binaries are built with it
cargo build --release --features serve
cp target/release/agtx ~/.local/bin/
```

### Updating

agtx checks GitHub once a day for a newer release and shows `⬆ 0.2.8 [u]` in the
board header when there is one. Press **`u`** for the details and one key to
install it, or from a shell:

```bash
agtx update          # download, verify and replace this binary in place
agtx update --check  # report only; exits 1 when an update is available
agtx --version
```

### Requirements

- **tmux** — agent sessions run in a dedicated tmux server
- **gh** (optional) — GitHub CLI for PR operations

## Usage

<details>
<summary><strong>Keyboard Shortcuts</strong></summary>

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `h/l` or `←/→` | Move between columns |

| `↩` | Open task (view agent session) |
| `Ctrl+f` | Open the task popup fullscreen; press again to return to windowed mode |
| `m` | Move task forward in workflow |
| `r` | Resume task (Review → Running) / Move back (Running → Planning) |
| `p` | Next phase (Review → Planning, cyclic plugins only) |
| `d` | Show git diff |
| `x` | Delete task |
| `/` | Search tasks |
| `P` | Select spec-driven workflow plugin |
| `,` | Open the config editor |
| `?` | Show every keyboard shortcut |
| `u` | Update agtx (only shown when a new release is available) |
| `W` | Serve the board to a phone (QR pairing, device list) |
| `O` | Toggle orchestrator agent (`--experimental`) |
| `e` | Toggle project sidebar |
| `q` | Quit |

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Task Creation Wizard</strong></summary>

Press `o` to create a new task. The wizard guides you through:
1. **Title** — enter a short task name
2. **Agent** — select the task's fallback agent or named instance (auto-skipped if only one is available)
3. **Plugin** — select a compatible workflow plugin (auto-skipped if only one option)
4. **Prompt** — write a detailed task description with inline references

The selected agent is used for phases without an explicit `[agents]` override.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Task Description Editor</strong></summary>

When writing a task description, you can reference files, skills, and other tasks inline:

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `#` or `@` | Fuzzy search and insert a file path |
| `/` | Fuzzy search and insert an agent skill/command (at line start or after space) |
| `!` | Fuzzy search and insert a task reference (at line start or after space) |

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Agent Sessions</strong></summary>

Each task runs in its own tmux window with a dedicated coding agent. The session persists across the entire task lifecycle — you can open the task popup at any time to see live agent output, or press `Ctrl+f` to open it fullscreen inside agtx.

- **Persistent context**: Conversation history is retained separately for every agent instance used by the task
- **Resume on return**: The first visit to an instance starts fresh; switching away and later returning resumes that instance's session (including plain built-in agents)
- **Inline view**: Press `↩` on any active task to open a scrollable tmux view inside the TUI
- **Fullscreen**: Press `Ctrl+f` to expand the task popup inside agtx. Press `Ctrl+f` again for windowed mode or `Ctrl+q` to return to the board.
- **Auto merge-conflict resolution**: When a Review task becomes idle, agtx checks for merge conflicts with the default branch using a non-destructive virtual merge (`git merge-tree`). If conflicts are detected, the agent is automatically sent the `/agtx:merge-conflicts` skill to resolve them and re-commit

</details>

## Why agtx? - The blackboard model

Most AI coding tools give you one agent, one task, one terminal. agtx is built on a different and much
older idea: the [**blackboard system**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackboard_system).

> A blackboard system is an approach where a common knowledge base — the *blackboard* — is iteratively
> updated by a diverse group of specialist *knowledge sources*, starting from a problem specification
> and ending with a solution. Each specialist writes a partial solution to the blackboard when the
> state on the board matches what it can contribute.
>
> — after [*Blackboard system*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackboard_system), Wikipedia (CC BY-SA)

That architecture was designed for problems that are too ill-defined for a single solver and too
interdependent to split cleanly up front. **Shipping software with coding agents is exactly that
problem**, so agtx implements the model directly:

The dependency graph gives the blackboard its structure. Tasks references they build on,
forming a graph of partial solutions - agtx holds downstream tasks until their dependencies reach
Review or Done, then carries the relevant diffs and artifacts into the dependent task's context.

           KNOWLEDGE SOURCES — one git worktree + tmux window each
```

| Blackboard model | In agtx |
|------------------|---------|
| **The blackboard** — a shared repository of the problem, partial solutions and contributed information | The kanban board, its dependency graph, and everything the phases leave behind: specs, plans, diffs, reviews, and phase artifacts. Every agent reads from and writes to the same board |
| **Knowledge sources** — independent specialists that never talk to each other, only to the board | Eight coding agent CLIs, each running in its **own git worktree and tmux window**. No agent can see another's context — they exchange only what lands on the board |
| **Control shell** — decides opportunistically which specialist runs next | Plugin phase gates determine when a task can advance; the dependency graph determines which tasks are ready to start; and the [orchestrator agent](#orchestrator-agent-experimental) coordinates the board over MCP |

## Mobile

[//]: <> (screenshot: the board on a phone — take it on a real device, then drag it into a GitHub comment and paste the attachment URL here, as with the TUI shot above)

Press `W` on the board to serve it to your phone. agtx prints a QR code; scanning
it pairs the device and opens an installable web app with the board, task
details, git diffs, and the agent's live terminal — including a keyboard, so you
can answer a permission prompt from wherever you are.

```bash
# Or start it yourself, without the TUI
agtx serve                       # this machine only
agtx serve --tunnel              # your tailnet — anywhere, your devices only
agtx serve --devices             # list paired devices
agtx serve --revoke <id>         # revoke one; --revoke-all for the lot
```

Two keys in the overlay, each a whole action: `s` serves to the local network,
`t` serves via your tailnet.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **agtx never opens a port on its own.** Serving lasts for as long as that agtx
> runs: quit it and the server stops, so the next time you want the board on
> your phone you press `W` then `s`/`t` again. Pairing does not change this — it
> is a credential, not a trigger, and a paired phone whose Mac is not serving
> just times out.

> [!NOTE]
> This needs a binary built with `--features serve`. The released ones are; a
> local `cargo build --release` without it reports "this build has no web
> server" under both options.

<details>
<summary><strong>Setup — on your wifi</strong></summary>

Works in about thirty seconds, and needs nothing installed.

1. Run `agtx` in a project and press `W`
2. Press `s`
3. Point your phone's camera at the QR code — the phone must be on the same wifi
4. In Safari or Chrome: **Share → Add to Home Screen**

That last step is what turns it into an app: its own icon, no address bar, and
the pairing remembered so you never scan again — but you still press `W` then
`s` to start serving each time you run agtx.

The URL here is a private address like `192.168.1.20`, which exists only on your
network. **It will not work on mobile data** — if you leave the house, the app
will sit there timing out. That is what the tailnet option below is for.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Setup — from anywhere, via Tailscale</strong></summary>

A few minutes once, then it is the same two taps forever. Your board becomes
reachable from your phone on any network, while staying invisible to everyone
else.

**One-time, on your Mac and your phone:**

1. Install [Tailscale](https://tailscale.com/download) on both
2. Sign both into the **same** account — they need to be on one tailnet
3. Enable Serve for your tailnet. It is off by default and is a separate switch
   from installing Tailscale — the step most people miss. The simplest way is to
   just press `t` in agtx once: Tailscale refuses with a one-time link that
   enables it for this machine, and agtx prints that link rather than swallowing
   it. Follow it, then press `t` again.

**Once more, to install the app:**

1. Run `agtx`, press `W`, press `t`
2. Scan the QR, and **Share → Add to Home Screen**

**Then, every time you want the board on your phone:** run `agtx`, press `W`,
press `t`. That is all — the pairing is remembered, so there is no QR to scan;
what you are starting is the server.

Now the icon on your home screen works on 5G, on hotel wifi, anywhere — the
address is an HTTPS name on your tailnet, and only devices signed into it can
resolve or reach it.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>When it does not work</strong></summary>

| What you see | What it means |
|---|---|
| `Unavailable: install Tailscale and sign this machine in` | `t` needs Tailscale on *this* machine. Install it, or use `s` for wifi. |
| `Unavailable: Tailscale is installed but not signed in` | Run `tailscale up`. |
| `could not start the tunnel: … Serve is not enabled on your tailnet` | The one-time switch above. agtx relays Tailscale's own message, which carries the URL that enables it. |
| Scanned fine, then the app times out | You pressed `s` (wifi) and the phone is on mobile data. Press `s` again to stop, then `t`. |
| The tailnet URL loads on the Mac but not the phone | The phone is not on the tailnet. Open the Tailscale app there and connect. |
| `This device is not authorised` | The pairing code expired — it lasts two minutes and is single-use. Press `s` or `t` again for a fresh QR. |
| The app worked yesterday, today it just times out | Nothing is serving. agtx does not start the server on its own — run it, press `W`, then `s`/`t`. The pairing is still good; the port is not open. |
| `No agtx running` on the board | Expected with no TUI open. Reading works; actions queue until one is. |

</details>

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Anything that can reach this server can read every task, every diff and every
> agent's screen, and can type into a running agent — which is arbitrary code
> execution on your machine. So: loopback needs no credential because reaching it
> already means being on the machine, and **everything wider requires a paired
> device**. Tokens are per-device and stored hashed, so a lost phone is revoked
> without disturbing the rest. `--tunnel public` publishes to the open internet
> and is deliberately not offered behind a keypress.

**Actions queue; they do not execute on their own.** Moving a task writes a
request that only a running `agtx` picks up, so with no TUI open your taps are
accepted and then wait — the board says so rather than pretending. Creating,
editing and deleting Backlog tasks take effect immediately, since they need no
agent. Starting the server with `W` keeps the two together by construction.

## Skills

Companion skills for any coding agent session: capture ideas, turn them into tasks on the agtx board, or hand a session the whole board.

| Skill | Command | When to use |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| **Brainstorm** | `/agtx:brainstorm` | Explore a feature idea — discussion only, no planning or implementation |
| **Sweep** | `/agtx:sweep` | Push conversation outcomes to the agtx board as tasks |
| **Oneshot** | `/agtx:oneshot` | Give a goal and let the session run the whole board unattended — see [Oneshot Skill](#oneshot-skill) |

**Typical flow:**
```
/agtx:brainstorm   ← explore the idea freely
      ↓
/agtx:sweep        ← extract tasks, confirm, push to board
      ↓
agtx board         ← tasks appear in Backlog, ready to advance
```

The brainstorm skill keeps the agent in discussion mode — asking questions, surfacing trade-offs, no code or plans. When the conversation feels complete, run `/agtx:sweep` to decompose outcomes into feature-level tasks and push them to the board with a single confirmation step.

### Install

The Claude Code plugin brings all three skills. Oneshot runs from Claude Code; the steps for the other agents install sweep.

<details>
<summary><strong>Claude Code</strong></summary>

```bash
claude plugin marketplace add fynnfluegge/agtx
claude plugin install agtx@agtx-marketplace
claude mcp add --scope user agtx -- agtx mcp-serve
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Codex</strong></summary>

```bash
codex mcp add agtx -- agtx mcp-serve
```

Add to your project's `.agents/plugins/marketplace.json`:
```json
{
  "name": "local-repo",
  "plugins": [
    {
      "name": "agtx",
      "source": {
        "source": "local",
        "path": "./plugins/agtx"
      },
      "policy": {
        "installation": "AVAILABLE",
        "authentication": "ON_INSTALL"
      },
      "category": "Productivity"
    }
  ]
}
```

Then in any Codex session: `@agtx:sweep` / `@agtx:brainstorm`

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Gemini CLI</strong></summary>

```bash
gemini mcp add agtx -- agtx mcp-serve
echo "@skills/sweep/SKILL.md" >> ~/GEMINI.md
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Cursor</strong></summary>

```bash
cursor mcp add agtx -- agtx mcp-serve
cp skills/sweep/SKILL.md ~/.cursor/rules/agtx-sweep.md
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Grok Build</strong></summary>

```bash
grok mcp add agtx -- agtx mcp-serve
mkdir -p ~/.grok/skills/agtx-sweep && cp skills/sweep/SKILL.md ~/.grok/skills/agtx-sweep/SKILL.md
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Antigravity</strong></summary>

```bash
agy mcp add agtx agtx mcp-serve
mkdir -p ~/.gemini/antigravity-cli/skills/agtx-sweep
cp skills/sweep/SKILL.md ~/.gemini/antigravity-cli/skills/agtx-sweep/SKILL.md
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>pi</strong></summary>

pi has no MCP client of its own — the `pi-mcp-adapter` package provides one and
reads servers in the standard `mcpServers` shape:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.pi/skills/agtx-sweep && cp skills/sweep/SKILL.md ~/.pi/skills/agtx-sweep/SKILL.md
```

Register `agtx mcp-serve` with the adapter, then in any pi session:
`/skill:agtx-sweep` / `/skill:agtx-brainstorm`

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Other</strong></summary>

Register `agtx mcp-serve` as an MCP server, then copy `skills/sweep/SKILL.md` into your agent's context.

</details>

> [!NOTE]
> The project must have been opened in agtx at least once to appear in `list_projects`. Run `agtx` in your project directory first.

## Oneshot Skill

> Give it a goal, not a task list. It runs the board until the goal is built and merged.

`/agtx:oneshot` turns a Claude Code session into the person sitting at the board. It breaks
the goal into milestones, turns the current milestone into tasks, starts them, watches the
workers, answers their questions, judges each Review, and merges the finished work into your
base branch — then plans the next wave from what was actually built. The workers write the
code; the oneshot session only writes tasks and its own state file.

### Setup

1. **Install the plugin and MCP server for Claude Code** — see [Install](#install).
2. **Let agtx answer trust prompts.** Nobody is at the board to answer an agent's trust or
   bypass-permissions dialog, so without this every task parks as blocked:
   ```toml
   # ~/.config/agtx/config.toml
   auto_trust = true
   ```
3. **Open your coding agent once in the project root** and accept its trust prompt. Task
   worktrees live inside the project, so they inherit that decision.
4. **Start from a clean base branch.** An empty repository works too — `git init -b main` is
   enough, and agtx makes the first commit.

### Run

```bash
# Terminal 1 — the board. Nothing moves without it.
cd your-project && agtx

# Terminal 2 — the session that runs the board
cd your-project && claude
> /agtx:oneshot Build a CLI todo app in Rust with SQLite storage and tests
```

Then leave it. Follow along on the board, or on your phone with `W`.

### What it does

- **Plans in waves.** A spine of 4–8 milestones first, then tasks for the current milestone
  only, with dependencies wired so a task waits for the ones it builds on. The next wave is
  planned from what the workers built.
- **Runs 3–6 tasks at once**, starting the next as its dependencies reach Review or Done.
- **Waits instead of polling.** `wait_for_board_change` blocks until a task needs attention
  and returns only what changed, so the session spends turns only when something happened.
- **Unblocks the workers.** It answers a tool's yes/no prompt, or a question its milestone
  plan already settles. Anything that would change the product goes to you under *Open
  questions* in `oneshot-state.md`, while the rest of the board keeps moving.
- **Judges Review.** A small fix goes to the reviewer in place with `send_to_task`; real
  rework sends the task back to Running.
- **Merges each task** with `move_to_done_and_merge`. On a conflict the task stays in Review
  and its own agent resolves it with `/agtx:merge-conflicts`.
- **Keeps a durable record** in `oneshot-state.md` — milestones, board, decisions and open
  questions — so a fresh session can pick up the run.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Oneshot merges into your **local** base branch, in your own checkout. Leave that checkout
> on the base branch with no uncommitted changes to tracked files while it runs. Otherwise the
> merge is refused and nothing is touched — agtx never switches your branch or stashes your
> work. Nothing is pushed.

> [!NOTE]
> A full run takes hours and many turns of the session running the board. Start with a small
> goal to see how it works on your project.

## Configuration

Config file location: `~/.config/agtx/config.toml`

### General

```toml
default_agent = "claude"
fullscreen_on_enter = false  # When true, Enter opens the tmux pane fullscreen inside agtx
agent_hooks = true           # Let agents report their own phase status via lifecycle hooks
auto_trust = false           # Answer agents' trust prompts on your behalf
update_check = true          # Check GitHub daily for a new release (see Updating)
```

### Worktree Base Branch

agtx creates a new git worktree for each task. By default it auto-detects the base branch in this
order: `main`, then `master`, then the current branch. You can override this to force a specific
base branch (for example `dev` or `develop`).

Global worktree defaults can be set here:

```toml
# ~/.config/agtx/config.toml
[worktree]
base_branch = "dev"
worktree_dir = ".worktrees"  # default: ".agtx/worktrees"
```

`worktree_dir` is the directory (relative to project root) where task worktrees are created. Defaults
to `.agtx/worktrees` if not set.

### Project Configuration

Per-project settings can be placed in `.agtx/config.toml` at the project root:

```toml
# Base branch used when creating new task worktrees (optional)
base_branch = "dev"

# Directory where worktrees are created (optional, default: ".agtx/worktrees")
worktree_dir = ".worktrees"

# Files to copy from project root into each new worktree (comma-separated)
# Paths are relative and preserve directory structure
copy_files = ".env, .env.local, web/.env.local"

# Shell command to run inside the worktree after creation and file copying
init_script = "scripts/init_worktree.sh"

# Shell command to run inside the worktree before removal
cleanup_script = "scripts/cleanup_worktree.sh"
```

`base_branch` controls which branch new task worktrees are created from. If omitted or empty, agtx
auto-detects `main`, `master`, or falls back to the current branch.

### Per-Phase Agent Configuration

By default, all phases use `default_agent`. You can override the agent for specific phases globally or per project:

```toml
# ~/.config/agtx/config.toml
default_agent = "claude"

[agents]
research = "gemini"
planning = "claude"
running = "claude"
review = "codex"
```

```toml
# .agtx/config.toml (project override — takes precedence over global)
[agents]
running = "codex"
```

### Named agent instances

A named instance gives one supported base agent another configuration identity. Named instances can
be selected in the task wizard, used as `default_agent`, or assigned to a phase. Resolution order is:

1. the phase's explicit `[agents]` value,
2. the instance selected in the task wizard,
3. `default_agent`.

The first visit to an instance starts a fresh session. agtx stores session identity per instance, so
switching `A → B → A` resumes A with the same base agent, profile, and model it originally used—even
if configuration was reloaded in the meantime. For OMP, agtx also passes a task-and-instance-specific
`--session-dir`, so two named instances remain isolated even when both omit `profile`; this changes only
conversation storage, not OMP authentication, settings, or caches. Existing string values such as
`running = "codex"` remain valid.

```toml
default_agent = "claude"

[agents]
review = "omp-review"

[agent_profiles.omp-review]
agent = "omp"
profile = "agtx-review"  # optional; supported by the OMP adapter
model = "cursor/gpt-5.6-sol:high"  # optional; use a value from `omp --list-models`
```

The schema is agent-neutral: instances without adapter-specific settings can also provide multiple
names for the same base agent. Fixed `model` values are supported for Claude Code, Codex, Gemini,
OpenCode, Cursor Agent, and OMP. OMP also supports `profile`.

### Jev model routing

Optional model routing chooses a capability tier when an instance first enters a phase, then maps
that tier to a model understood by the base harness. It is disabled when `[model_routing]` is absent.

```toml
[model_routing]
router = "jev"
api_key_env = "TYPESAFE_API_KEY"
endpoint = "https://api.typesafe.ai/v1/systemone"
jev_model = "jev-latest"
timeout_ms = 3500
confidence_threshold = 0.34

[model_routing.phases.research]
fallback = "standard"
minimum = "standard"

[model_routing.phases.planning]
fallback = "high"
minimum = "high"

[model_routing.phases.running]
fallback = "standard"
minimum = "standard"

[model_routing.phases.review]
fallback = "high"
minimum = "high"

[model_routing.models.claude]
quick = "haiku"
standard = "sonnet"
high = "opus"
premium = "opus"

[model_routing.models.codex]
quick = "gpt-5.1-codex-mini"
standard = "gpt-5.2-codex"
high = "gpt-5.3-codex"
premium = "gpt-5.3-codex"
```

Set the environment variable named by `api_key_env`; the key is never written to disk. Jev receives
the task text, phase, and base-agent name. If the key, API, response, or selected tier is unavailable,
agtx starts the harness with the configured fallback model. Low-confidence choices also use the
fallback, while `minimum` prevents a phase from selecting a weaker tier.

A fixed `model` on a named instance takes precedence and bypasses Jev. A routed decision is made
once per task instance and reused for launch, resume, and later returns to that instance, even after
a config reload. Use distinct named instances when phases need distinct conversations or models.
A project-local `[model_routing]` replaces the global routing section; because it can select an API
endpoint and key environment variable, it is ignored until the project config is trusted.

Routing adapters are verified for Claude Code, Codex, Gemini, OpenCode, Cursor Agent, and OMP.
Copilot, Grok, Antigravity, and Earendil Pi keep their normal/default model until their CLI adapter is
verified.

#### Oh My Pi (OMP) setup


OMP is a separate agent from Earendil Pi (`pi`). Install it using an
[upstream-supported method](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@oh-my-pi/pi-coding-agent); the command
below requires Bun:

```bash
bun install --global @oh-my-pi/pi-coding-agent
omp --list-models
omp
```

Initialize each named OMP profile with `omp --profile <name>` unless its provider credentials come
from the environment. Models under the `cursor/...` provider also require working Cursor
credentials; choose another provider from `omp --list-models` otherwise.

To use one OMP instance for every phase:

```toml
default_agent = "omp-default"

[agent_profiles.omp-default]
agent = "omp"
model = "cursor/gpt-5.6-sol:high"
```

To use separate profiles and models per phase, replace the illustrative model values below with
entries reported by your `omp --list-models`:

```toml
default_agent = "omp-default"

[agents]
research = "omp-research"
planning = "omp-planning"
running = "omp-running"
review = "omp-review"

[agent_profiles.omp-default]
agent = "omp"

[agent_profiles.omp-research]
agent = "omp"
profile = "agtx-research"
model = "cursor/<research-model-from-omp-list-models>"

[agent_profiles.omp-planning]
agent = "omp"
profile = "agtx-planning"
model = "cursor/<planning-model-from-omp-list-models>"

[agent_profiles.omp-running]
agent = "omp"
profile = "agtx-running"
model = "cursor/<running-model-from-omp-list-models>"

[agent_profiles.omp-review]
agent = "omp"
profile = "agtx-review"
model = "cursor/<review-model-from-omp-list-models>"
```

Global and project `agent_profiles` are merged by name; a project definition replaces a same-named
global definition.

<summary><b>Creating a Plugin</b></summary>

Place your plugin at `.agtx/plugins/<name>/plugin.toml` in your project root (or `~/.config/agtx/plugins/<name>/plugin.toml` for global use). It will appear in the plugin selector automatically.

**Minimal example** — a plugin that uses custom slash commands:

```toml
name = "my-plugin"
description = "My custom workflow"

[commands]
research = "/my-plugin:research {task}"
planning = "/my-plugin:plan"
running = "/my-plugin:execute"
review = "/my-plugin:review"

[prompts]
planning = "Task: {task}"
```

**Full reference** with all available fields:

```toml
name = "my-plugin"
description = "My custom workflow"

# Shell command to run in the worktree after creation, before the agent starts.
# {agent} is replaced with the agent name (claude, codex, gemini, etc.)

# Restrict to specific agents (empty or omitted = all agents supported)
supported_agents = ["claude", "codex", "gemini", "opencode"]

# Use base names here. A named profile such as "omp-review" is checked as
# "omp", so an OMP-compatible custom plugin (for example ai-rules) should list:
# supported_agents = ["omp"]

# Extra directories to copy from project root into each worktree.
# Agent config dirs (.claude, .gemini, .codex, .github/agents, .config/opencode)

copy_files = ["PROJECT.md", "REQUIREMENTS.md"]

# When true, enables Review → Planning transition via the `p` key.
# Each cycle increments the phase counter ({phase} placeholder).
# Use this for multi-milestone workflows (e.g. plan → execute → review → next milestone).
cyclic = false

#   Cursor/Grok/Antigravity: /my-plugin-plan (colon -> hyphen)
# Omitted phases fall back to agent-native agtx skill invocation
# (e.g. /agtx:plan for Claude, $agtx-plan for Codex).
# Set to "" to skip sending a command for that phase.
# Use {phase} for cycle-aware commands (replaced with the current cycle number).
# Use {task} to inline the task description.
[commands]
preresearch = "/my-plugin:research {task}"  # Used only when no research artifacts exist yet
research = "/my-plugin:discuss {phase}"
planning = "/my-plugin:plan {phase}"
running = "/my-plugin:execute {phase}"
review = "/my-plugin:review {phase}"

# Prompt templates sent as task content after the command.
# {task} = task title + description, {task_id} = unique task ID, {phase} = cycle number.
# Omitted phases send no prompt (the skill/command handles instructions).
[prompts]
research = "Task: {task}"

# Text patterns to wait for in the tmux pane before sending the prompt.
# Useful when a command triggers an interactive prompt that must appear first.
# Polls every 500ms, times out after 5 minutes.
[prompt_triggers]
research = "What do you want to build?"

# Files/dirs to copy from worktree back to project root after a phase completes.
# Triggered automatically when the phase artifact is detected (spinner → checkmark).
# Useful for sharing research artifacts (specs, plans) across worktrees.
[copy_back]
research = ["PROJECT.md", "REQUIREMENTS.md", ".my-plugin"]

# Auto-dismiss interactive prompts that appear before the prompt trigger.
# Each rule fires when ALL detect patterns are present and the pane is stable.
# Response is newline-separated keystrokes (e.g. "2\nEnter" sends "2" then Enter).
[[auto_dismiss]]
detect = ["Map codebase", "Skip mapping", "Enter to select"]
response = "2\nEnter"
```

**What happens at each phase transition:**

1. The **command** is sent to the agent via tmux (e.g., `/my-plugin:plan`)
2. If a **prompt_trigger** is set, agtx waits for that prompt trigger to appear in the tmux pane
3. The **prompt** is sent with `{task}`, `{task_id}`, and `{phase}` replaced
4. agtx polls for the **artifact** file — when found, the spinner becomes a checkmark
5. If **copy_back** is configured, artifacts are copied from worktree to project root on completion
6. If the agent appears idle (no output for 15s), the spinner becomes a pause icon

**Phase gating:** Whether a phase can be entered directly from Backlog is derived from the plugin config. If a phase's command or prompt contains `{task}`, it can receive task context and is accessible from Backlog. If neither has `{task}`, the phase depends on a prior phase and is blocked until that artifact exists. For example, OpenSpec's `/opsx:propose {task}` allows direct Backlog → Planning, but `/opsx:apply` (no `{task}`) blocks Backlog → Running until proposal artifacts exist.

**Preresearch fallback:** When pressing `R` on a task, if `preresearch` is configured and no research artifacts from `copy_back` exist in the project root yet, the `preresearch` command is used instead of `research`. This lets plugins run a one-time project setup (e.g. `/gsd:new-project`) before switching to the regular research command for subsequent tasks. If the plugin has no research command at all (e.g. OpenSpec), pressing `R` shows a warning.

**Cyclic workflows:** When `cyclic = true`, pressing `p` in Review moves the task back to Planning with an incremented phase counter. This enables multi-milestone workflows where each cycle (plan → execute → review) produces artifacts in a separate `{phase}` directory.

**Custom skills:** If your plugin provides its own skill files, place them in the plugin directory:

```
.agtx/plugins/my-plugin/
├── plugin.toml
└── skills/
    ├── agtx-plan/SKILL.md
    ├── agtx-execute/SKILL.md
    └── agtx-review/SKILL.md
```

These override the built-in agtx skills and are automatically deployed to each agent's native discovery path (`.claude/commands/`, `.codex/skills/`, `.gemini/commands/`, etc.) in every worktree.

```

### Tmux Structure

- **Server**: All sessions run on a dedicated tmux server named `agtx`
- **Sessions**: Each project gets its own tmux session (named after the project)
- **Windows**: Each task gets its own window within the project's session

```bash
# List all sessions
tmux -L agtx list-sessions

# List all windows across sessions
tmux -L agtx list-windows -a

# Attach to the agtx server
tmux -L agtx attach
```

### Data Storage

- **Database**: `~/Library/Application Support/agtx/` (macOS) or `~/.config/agtx/` (Linux)
- Config: `~/.config/agtx/config.toml`
- **Worktrees**: `.agtx/worktrees/` in each project
- **Tmux**: Dedicated server `agtx` with per-project sessions

## Docker Sandbox

Run agtx in an isolated Docker container so agents can only touch the project you pass in — no access to the rest of your home directory, credentials are read-only, and any files the agent creates in the project are owned by your host user.

```bash
# Run agtx on a project
./docker/sandbox.sh path/to/your-project

# Or from inside the project directory
./docker/sandbox.sh
```

The sandbox:
- Mounts only the target project as writable; everything else on the host is inaccessible
- Copies `~/.claude` credentials read-only at startup so they are never written back to the host
- Runs as a non-root user whose UID/GID matches your host user (files created inside the container appear correctly owned on the host)
- Stores agtx state in named Docker volumes (persists across runs, isolated from your host's agtx data)
- Pre-accepts the bypass permissions prompt, which is appropriate in an isolated container

> [!NOTE]
> Requires [Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) (Linux) or [Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/) (macOS/Windows). The image is built automatically on first run and cached for subsequent runs.

## MCP Server

The agtx MCP server (`agtx mcp-serve`) exposes the board to any coding agent session via the [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io). Used by the orchestrator agent, the oneshot skill, and the brainstorm & sweep skills.

### Modes

| Mode | Command | Used by |
|------|---------|---------|
| **Global** | `agtx mcp-serve` | Brainstorm, sweep and oneshot skills — works across all projects |
| **Project-scoped** | `agtx mcp-serve <path>` | Orchestrator — bound to one project at startup |

In global mode all tools require a `project_id` parameter. Call `list_projects` first to resolve it.

### Tools

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `list_projects` | List all projects indexed in agtx |
| `get_config` | The project's effective config, global and project merged — e.g. whether `auto_trust` is on |
| `list_tasks` | List tasks with their phase status, optionally filtered by status (descriptions on request) |
| `get_task` | Get task details + `allowed_actions` for valid transitions |
| `wait_for_board_change` | Block until a task needs attention, then return only what changed and the outcome of queued transitions |
| `create_task` | Create a single backlog task |
| `create_tasks_batch` | Batch-create tasks with index-based dependencies |
| `update_task` | Modify a backlog task (title, description, deps) |
| `delete_task` | Delete a backlog task |
| `move_task` | Queue a phase transition, including `move_to_done_and_merge` |
| `get_transition_status` | Check if a queued transition completed or errored |
| `check_conflicts` | Non-destructive merge conflict check against default branch |
| `get_notifications` | Fetch pending orchestrator notifications |
| `read_pane_content` | Read the last N lines of a task's tmux pane |
| `send_to_task` | Send a message to a task's agent (Planning, Running or Review) |

## Orchestrator Agent (Experimental)

> Press `O` and walk away. Come back to changes ready to merge.

The orchestrator is an AI agent that **drives other AI agents to completion**. You triage tasks into Planning or Running — the orchestrator takes over from there, advancing each task through its phases until it lands in Review, ready for you to merge.

```bash
agtx --experimental   # then press O
```

**What it does:**
- Monitors tasks in Planning and Running
- Advances tasks automatically as phases complete (Planning → Running → Review)
- Respects plugin phase rules — checks `allowed_actions` before each transition
- Detects stuck tasks (idle for 1+ minute without a phase artifact) and reads the agent pane to diagnose the cause
- Nudges stuck agents, answers CLI prompts automatically, or escalates to you with a reason when human input is needed

**You triage. It executes.** Move tasks from Backlog into Planning or Running — the orchestrator handles the rest. Merging is your call. For a session that owns the whole board, from planning the work to merging it, see the [Oneshot Skill](#oneshot-skill).

### MCP Integration

The orchestrator communicates with agtx through the [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io). agtx ships with a built-in MCP server (`agtx serve`) that exposes the kanban board as a set of tools over JSON-RPC via stdio.

```
┌─────────────-┐     MCP (stdio)     ┌──────────────┐     SQLite     ┌─────┐
│ Orchestrator │ ←─────────────────→ │  MCP Server  │ ←────────────→ │ DB  │
│ (Claude Code)│                     │ (agtx serve) │                └──┬──┘
└──────┬───────┘                     └──────────────┘                   │
       │  push-when-idle notifications                                  │
┌──────┴───────┐                                                        │
│   TUI (agtx) │ ←───────────────────────────────────────────────────--─┘
└──────────────┘
```

**How it works:**
1. When you press `O`, the TUI registers the MCP server with the orchestrator agent via `claude mcp add-json --scope local`
2. The orchestrator receives phase completion notifications pushed to its tmux pane when idle
3. It reacts by calling `get_task` to check `allowed_actions`, then `move_task` to advance the task
4. The TUI processes the transition request, executes all side effects (agent switching, skill deployment, prompt sending), and updates the database
5. If a task has been idle for 1+ minute without a phase artifact, the orchestrator is notified — it reads the pane with `read_pane_content`, then either nudges the agent with `send_to_task` or calls `move_task` with `escalate_to_user` to flag it for your attention
6. Escalated tasks show a `⚠` badge on the kanban board; opening the task popup shows the reason and dismisses the flag
7. MCP registration is cleaned up when the orchestrator is stopped

## Benchmark

agtx includes a [SWE-bench Lite](https://www.swebench.com) benchmark runner that uses agtx itself as the agent orchestration layer — driving coding agent workflows against 300 real GitHub bug-fix tasks via the MCP server.

See **[benchmark/README.md](benchmark/README.md)** for setup, usage, bundled configs, and evaluation instructions.

- **Write a plugin** — A single `plugin.toml` is all you need. See [Creating a Plugin](#plugins) for the full reference
- **Add a new agent** — Integrate your favorite AI coding CLI. See the [architecture docs](CLAUDE.md) for how agents are structured
- **Improve documentation** — Found something unclear? Help others by improving it
- **Report bugs** — Open an [issue](https://github.com/fynnfluegge/agtx/issues). Reproduction steps are always appreciated
- **Browse open issues** — Check the [`good first issue`](https://github.com/fynnfluegge/agtx/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22) label for beginner-friendly tasks

## Development
