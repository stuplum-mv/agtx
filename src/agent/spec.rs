//! One declarative record per coding agent.
//!
//! Everything agtx knows about an agent that is *data* lives here; everything
//! that is *behaviour* is selected by a small closed enum stored in the record
//! rather than by re-matching the agent's name in each function. The short
//! version is that a name-match ending in `_ => {}` cannot tell you an agent was
//! only half added, and a kind-match over a closed enum can.
//!
//! The record is deliberately pure data (no closures, no `String`) so that it
//! can later be deserialized from a `[[agents]]` block in `config.toml`, which
//! is what makes user-defined agents possible.
//!
//! Adding an agent is one entry in [`AGENT_SPECS`]. If a field cannot express
//! it, the right move is one new enum variant plus one new match arm in the one
//! function that reads that enum — not a new match on the agent's name.
